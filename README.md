# todo-app-marionette-handlebars

Sample app to demonstrate basic Marionette.js features.

There are here the same versions of Backbone and Marionette as are used currently (August 2023) on Macys website. 
* backbone: 1.2.3
* backbone.marionette: 2.4.4

Should be noticed Marionette ver is pretty old (2 major versions behind). So, make sure you are reffering to the correct documentation with relevant API information: https://marionettejs.com/docs/v2.4.4/
